This Geoportal was created as a [Provita](https://www.provita.org.ve/) initiative to make available to the general public a variety of geospatial data sources about Venezuela. Most of the information was created and developed within projects managed by [Provita](https://www.provita.org.ve/). For this reason, there is more detailed information about certain regions of the country, e.g., the Venezuelan Amazon.

We make this material available to be queried and used by anyone, respecting the authors' copyrights. This allows contributions from more people with varied areas of expertise. In addition, in this site you will be able to find geospatial information generated by other institutions, adapted to Venezuela, which can be used as the basis for your own research and analysis.

We hope that the information published on this site can be useful to many of you. Do not hesitate to [contact us](/contact) with any suggestions, comments or input.
